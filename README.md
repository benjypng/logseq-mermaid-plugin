> BREAKING CHANGE: The latest version generates the image file without using a mermaid.ink server. However, this breaks existing mermaid codeblocks.

# Usage

1. Type `/Draw mermaid diagram`.
2. Modify the renderer with the desired scaling factor (default is 3), e.g. `{{renderer :mermaid_66b0fcff-ea9e-4909-9aab-554186001e73, 3}}` where 3 is the scaling factor.
3. Enter your mermaid code into the code block.

# Installation

Recommend to install from the marketplace. If not, download a release and manually load it in Logseq.
