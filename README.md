> BREAKING CHANGE: The latest version generates the image file without using a mermaid.ink server. However, this breaks existing mermaid codeblocks.

# Overview

Create mermaid diagrams in image format on-the-fly. 

# Usage

1. Type `/Draw mermaid diagram`.
2. Modify the renderer with the desired scaling factor (default is 3).
3. Enter your mermaid code into the code block.

# Installation

Recommend to install from the marketplace. If not, download a release and manually load it in Logseq.
